Assignment Goal: Build 4(interlinked) web pages using HTML and style the contents using CSS.
</b>
I created a HTML pages with the following information:
Home page
Form page
Table page
Media page.

My Home page has a navigation menu at the top. It links the pages together so that thereâ€™s no dead end and you can always go from the home page to the other pages and then back to the home page.
A "back to top" button is available at the bottom of this page.

The following were included altogether;
Home page: My name, Picture, Biography, My goal for the Diploma course I am running with AltSchool Africa, Reasons for Joining AltSchool Africa, Education (my past education), Hobbies and skills.

The Form page  (consisting register page, sign in page and reset password page:
My register page has the following fields: First Name, Last Name, Phone, Gender (dropdown option), Country(dropdown), State/province, Username, Password & Confirm password. The form has a submit button and basic HTML validation.
Sign in page has a username field and a password field with basic HTML validation to the login form. It has a submit button.

Table page that displays a Table showing all the schools and courses offered by AltSchool Africa. I intend to make the webpage more functional as I further develop my front-end development skills as the goal for now is to work with what I had learnt about HTML & CSS in the First semester.

Media page contains some HTML media elements (images, video, audio) that I also learnt during the First semester.
An External CSS document created by me was used in styling the entire content of this project.
